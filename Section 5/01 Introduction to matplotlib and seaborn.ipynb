    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is the \"grandfather\" library of data visualization with Python. It was created by John Hunter. He created it to try to replicate MatLab's (another programming language) plotting capabilities in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a Python 2D & 3D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits."

This helps us understand the data by displaying it in a visual context to unearth any hidden correlations between variables or trends that might not be obvious initially. Seaborn has a high-level interface as compared to the low level of Matplotlib.\n"

    "Have you ever used the ggplot2 library in R? Itâ€™s one of the best visualization packages in any tool or language. Seaborn gives us the same overall feel and functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main differences I believe is that the Seaborn plots have a better defult resolution than the ggplot2 graphics and the syntax required can be much less (but this is dependent on circumstance). Seaborn uses a programmatic approach whereby the user can access the classes in Seaborn"
